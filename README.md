I'm a computer and data scientist who can comfortably explore dataset with various exploratory data analysis approaches. I am proficient in Python, C, C++, Java, but I mostly use Python. Some of Python libraries I have experienced working with include NumPy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn. Aside from office 365, I am an advanced user of Ms-Excel with proven Coursera and LinkedIn badges. I am an expert in Machine Learning both in the theoretical aspects and practical implementations. Aside from Ms-Excel, I can create a sophisticated dashboard using PowerBI and Tableau with interactive features. I enjoy working with a positive-minded team and like to contribute to the success of the team by collaborating and also learn from them. I use various learning platforms, such as <a href="https://coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Datacamp</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://realpython.com/">RealPython</a>, <a href="http://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeekForGeek</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechalleng.es/bites/">Pybites</a>, for professional development.
