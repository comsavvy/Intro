I'm a computer and data scientist who can comfortably explore a dataset with various exploratory data analysis approaches. I am proficient in Python, C, C++, Java, but I mostly use Python. Some of Python libraries I have experienced working with includes NumPy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn. Aside from all other tools of office 365, I am an advanced user of Ms-Excel with a proven Coursera and LinkedIn badges. I am an expert in Machine Learning both in the theoretical aspects and practical implementations. Aside from Ms-Excel, I can create a sophisticated dashboard using PowerBI and Tableau with interactive features.
I enjoy working with teams having an ambitious goal and commitment, as I'm glad sharing my knowledge and also learning from others.
