I'm a computer and data scientist who can comfortably explore datasets with various exploratory data analysis approaches. I am proficient in Python, C, C++, and Java, but I mostly use Python. Aside from office 365, I am an advanced user of Ms-Excel with proven Coursera and LinkedIn badges. I am an expert in Machine Learning both in the theoretical aspects and practical implementations. Aside from using Ms-Excel, I can create a sophisticated dashboard using PowerBI and Tableau with captivating and interactive features. 
I enjoy working with a positives minded team and also like to contribute to the success of the team by collaborating and also learning.
I use various learning platforms, such as <a href="https://coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Datacamp</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">UDEMY</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://realpython.com/">RealPython</a>, <a href="http://medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeekForGeek</a>, and <a href="https://www.codechalleng.es/bites/">Pybites</a>, for professional development.
